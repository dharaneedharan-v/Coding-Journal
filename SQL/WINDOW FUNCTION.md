# _What are Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD/LAG):_

_Window functions are SQL analytical functions that perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, they don't collapse rows into groups but return a value for each individual row based on a "window" of related data._

- _RANK() and DENSE_RANK() assign rankings to rows based on specified criteria._
- _LEAD() and LAG() access data from subsequent or previous rows without joins._
- _All use OVER() clause to define the window of data to operate on._
- _Essential for analytical queries, reporting, and data analysis tasks._

## _**Why Use Window Functions?**_

_Window functions are powerful because they allow you to:_

- _Rank employees by salary within each department without grouping._
- _Compare current row values with previous/next rows (time series analysis)._
- _Perform running totals, moving averages, and analytical calculations._
- _Avoid complex self-joins that would otherwise be needed._
- _Create sophisticated reports with rankings and comparisons in a single query._

# _üîπ RANK() Function_

_RANK() assigns a rank to each row within a partition, with gaps for tied values._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
RANK() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
)
```

### _**Key Characteristics:**_

- _Assigns same rank to tied values_
- _Leaves gaps after tied ranks (1, 2, 2, 4, 5...)_
- _PARTITION BY divides data into groups (optional)_
- _ORDER BY determines ranking criteria (required)_

### _**Example 1: Employee Salary Ranking**_

```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    department,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS overall_rank,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM employees;
```

_Result:_

```
employee_id | first_name | department | salary | overall_rank | dept_rank
------------|------------|------------|--------|--------------|----------
101         | John       | IT         | 75000  | 1            | 1
102         | Sarah      | IT         | 70000  | 2            | 2
103         | Mike       | HR         | 70000  | 2            | 1
104         | Lisa       | HR         | 65000  | 4            | 2
105         | Tom        | IT         | 60000  | 5            | 3
```

---

# _üîπ DENSE_RANK() Function_

_DENSE_RANK() assigns ranks without gaps, even when there are ties._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
)
```

### _**Key Characteristics:**_

- _Assigns same rank to tied values_
- _No gaps in ranking sequence (1, 2, 2, 3, 4...)_
- _Consecutive rankings regardless of ties_

### _**Example 2: Dense Ranking Comparison**_

```sql
SELECT 
    student_name,
    score,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank_with_gaps,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS dense_rank_no_gaps
FROM exam_results
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

_Result:_

```
student_name | score | rank_with_gaps | dense_rank_no_gaps
-------------|-------|----------------|-------------------
Alice        | 95    | 1              | 1
Bob          | 90    | 2              | 2
Charlie      | 90    | 2              | 2
David        | 85    | 4              | 3  ‚Üê Notice: 3 vs 4
Eva          | 80    | 5              | 4
```

---

# _üîπ LAG() Function_

_LAG() accesses data from a previous row in the result set without using a self-join._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
LAG(column_name, offset, default_value) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
)
```

### _**Parameters:**_

- _column_name: Column to retrieve from previous row_
- _offset: Number of rows back (default = 1)_
- _default_value: Value when no previous row exists (optional)_

### _**Example 3: Sales Comparison with Previous Month**_

```sql
SELECT 
    month_year,
    sales_amount,
    LAG(sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY month_year) AS previous_month_sales,
    LAG(sales_amount, 2) OVER (ORDER BY month_year) AS two_months_ago,
    sales_amount - LAG(sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY month_year) AS month_over_month_change
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY month_year;
```

_Result:_

```
month_year | sales_amount | previous_month_sales | two_months_ago | month_over_month_change
-----------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------
2024-01    | 50000        | NULL                | NULL           | NULL

2024-03    | 48000        | 55000               | 50000          | -7000
2024-04    | 62000        | 48000               | 55000          | 14000
```

---

# _üîπ LEAD() Function_

_LEAD() accesses data from a subsequent row in the result set._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
LEAD(column_name, offset, default_value) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
)
```

### _**Parameters:**_

- _column_name: Column to retrieve from next row_

        PARTITION BY employee_id 
        ORDER BY promotion_date
    ) AS next_promotion_date
FROM employee_promotions
ORDER BY employee_id, promotion_date;
```

# _üîπ Alternative Approaches_

### _**Instead of Window Functions (Traditional Approach):**_

#### _Old Way: Self-Join for Ranking_

```sql
-- ‚ùå Complex self-join approach
SELECT e1.employee_id, e1.salary,
       COUNT(e2.employee_id) + 1 AS rank
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e2.salary > e1.salary
GROUP BY e1.employee_id, e1.salary
ORDER BY rank;
```

#### _New Way: Window Function_

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Simple window function
SELECT employee_id, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

### _**Instead of LAG/LEAD: Self-Join with ROW_NUMBER**_

```sql
-- ‚ùå Complex approach
SELECT s1.month_year, s1.sales, s2.sales AS previous_month
FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY month_year) AS rn 
      FROM sales) s1
LEFT JOIN (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY month_year) AS rn 
           FROM sales) s2 ON s1.rn = s2.rn + 1;

-- ‚úÖ Simple LAG function
SELECT month_year, sales,
       LAG(sales) OVER (ORDER BY month_year) AS previous_month
FROM sales;
```

---

# _üîπ Performance Tips_

### _**Optimization Best Practices:**_

1. _**Index PARTITION BY and ORDER BY columns**_
    
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_emp_dept_salary ON employees (department, salary DESC);
    ```
    
2. _**Use appropriate PARTITION BY to reduce window size**_
    
    ```sql
    -- ‚úÖ Better: Smaller partitions
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
    
    -- ‚ùå Slower: Large window
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)
    ```
    
3. _**Filter before window functions when possible**_
    
    ```sql
    -- ‚úÖ Filter first, then apply window function
    SELECT employee_id, salary,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM employees
    WHERE active = 1 AND department = 'IT';
    ```

# _What are Advanced Window Functions:_

_Advanced window functions are analytical SQL functions that perform complex calculations across a defined set of rows (window frame) related to the current row. They include positional functions (FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE), distribution functions (NTILE, CUME_DIST, PERCENT_RANK), and frame specifications that control exactly which rows to include in calculations._

- _FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE access specific positioned values within a window._
- _NTILE divides data into equal groups (quartiles, percentiles, etc.)._
- _CUME_DIST and PERCENT_RANK provide statistical distribution information._
- _Frame Clause precisely controls which rows are included in the window._
- _Window Clause allows reusing window definitions for cleaner code._

## _**Why Use Advanced Window Functions?**_

_These functions are essential for:_

- _Statistical analysis and percentile calculations in business reporting._
- _Creating running totals, moving averages, and time-based calculations._
- _Accessing first/last values in groups without complex subqueries._
- _Distributing data into equal buckets for analysis (quartiles, deciles)._
- _Performance analytics, sales reporting, and data science applications._
- _Avoiding expensive self-joins and correlated subqueries._

---

# _üîπ FIRST_VALUE() Function_

_FIRST_VALUE() returns the first value in an ordered set within the window frame._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
    [frame_clause]
)

```

### _**Example 1: First Sale in Each Month**_

```sql
SELECT
    sales_date,
    salesperson,
    sale_amount,
    FIRST_VALUE(sale_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sales_date)
        ORDER BY sales_date
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) AS first_sale_of_month,
    FIRST_VALUE(salesperson) OVER (
        PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sales_date)
        ORDER BY sales_date
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) AS first_salesperson_of_month
FROM sales_data
ORDER BY sales_date;

```

_Result:_

```
sales_date | salesperson | sale_amount | first_sale_of_month | first_salesperson_of_month
-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------
2024-01-05 | John        | 1000        | 1000               | John
2024-01-10 | Sarah       | 1500        | 1000               | John
2024-01-15 | Mike        | 800         | 1000               | John
2024-02-02 | Lisa        | 2000        | 2000               | Lisa
2024-02-08 | Tom         | 1200        | 2000               | Lisa

```

---

# _üîπ LAST_VALUE() Function_

_LAST_VALUE() returns the last value in an ordered set within the window frame._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
    [frame_clause]
)

```

### _**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Frame Clause Required**_

_Without proper frame clause, LAST_VALUE() only sees up to current row!_

### _**Example 2: Last Sale in Each Month**_

```sql
SELECT
    sales_date,
    salesperson,
    sale_amount,
    LAST_VALUE(sale_amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sales_date)
        ORDER BY sales_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS last_sale_of_month,
    LAST_VALUE(salesperson) OVER (
        PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sales_date)
        ORDER BY sales_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS last_salesperson_of_month
FROM sales_data
ORDER BY sales_date;

```

---

# _üîπ Frame Clause - The Heart of Window Functions_

_Frame Clause defines exactly which rows within the partition are included in the window calculation._

### _**Complete Frame Syntax:**_

```sql
{ROWS | RANGE} BETWEEN frame_start AND frame_end

```

### _**Frame Boundaries:**_

- _UNBOUNDED PRECEDING - From the first row of partition_
- _UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING - To the last row of partition_
- _CURRENT ROW - The current row_
- _n PRECEDING - n rows before current row_
- _n FOLLOWING - n rows after current row_

### _**Common Frame Patterns:**_

### _1. Default Frame (Problematic for LAST_VALUE)_

```sql
-- ‚ùå Default frame: RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date)  -- Only sees up to current row!

```

### _2. Full Partition Frame_

```sql
-- ‚úÖ See entire partition
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

```

### _3. Moving Window Frame_

```sql
-- ‚úÖ 3-row moving window (previous, current, next)
ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING

```

### _4. Running Total Frame_

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Running total from start to current
ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING

```

### _**Example 3: Frame Clause Comparison**_

```sql
SELECT
    sales_date,
    daily_sales,

    -- Moving 3-day average
    AVG(daily_sales) OVER (
        ORDER BY sales_date
        ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
    ) AS moving_3day_avg,

    -- Running total
    SUM(daily_sales) OVER (
        ORDER BY sales_date
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) AS running_total,

    -- Last value with correct frame
    LAST_VALUE(daily_sales) OVER (
        ORDER BY sales_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS max_sales_in_dataset

FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY sales_date;

```

---

# _üîπ Window Clause - Reusing Window Definitions_

_Window Clause allows you to define a window once and reuse it multiple times for cleaner code._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
SELECT columns...
FROM table
WINDOW window_name AS (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    [ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...]
    [frame_clause]
)

```

### _**Example 4: Using Window Clause**_

```sql
-- ‚ùå Without Window Clause (Repetitive)
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest_in_dept,
    LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS lowest_in_dept,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS avg_dept_salary
FROM employees;

-- ‚úÖ With Window Clause (Clean)
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER w AS highest_in_dept,
    LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER w AS lowest_in_dept,
    AVG(salary) OVER w AS avg_dept_salary
FROM employees
WINDOW w AS (
    PARTITION BY department
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
);

```

---

# _üîπ NTH_VALUE() Function_

_NTH_VALUE() returns the value at a specific position (nth row) within the window frame._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
NTH_VALUE(column_name, n) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
    [frame_clause]
)

```

### _**Example 5: Getting 2nd and 3rd Highest Salaries**_

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    department,
    salary,
    NTH_VALUE(salary, 1) OVER w AS highest_salary,
    NTH_VALUE(salary, 2) OVER w AS second_highest,
    NTH_VALUE(salary, 3) OVER w AS third_highest,
    NTH_VALUE(first_name, 2) OVER w AS second_highest_employee
FROM employees
WINDOW w AS (
    PARTITION BY department
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
)
ORDER BY department, salary DESC;

```

_Result:_

```
employee_id | first_name | department | salary | highest_salary | second_highest | third_highest | second_highest_employee
------------|------------|------------|--------|----------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------
101         | John       | IT         | 75000  | 75000          | NULL           | NULL          | NULL
102         | Sarah      | IT         | 70000  | 75000          | 70000          | NULL          | Sarah
103         | Mike       | IT         | 65000  | 75000          | 70000          | 65000         | Sarah

```

---

# _üîπ NTILE() Function_

_NTILE() divides the result set into n roughly equal groups and assigns a group number to each row._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
NTILE(number_of_groups) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
)

```

### _**Example 6: Quartile Analysis**_

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    first_name,

# _üîπ CUME_DIST() Function_

_CUME_DIST() calculates the cumulative distribution (percentile) of a value within a group. Returns values between 0 and 1._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
CUME_DIST() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
)

```

### _**Formula:**_

_CUME_DIST = (Number of rows with values <= current row value) / (Total number of rows)_

### _**Example 7: Cumulative Distribution Analysis**_

```sql
SELECT
    student_id,
    student_name,
    exam_score,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY exam_score) AS overall_percentile,
    ROUND(CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY exam_score) * 100, 2) AS percentile_score,

    -- Within class percentile
    CUME_DIST() OVER (
        PARTITION BY class_id
        ORDER BY exam_score
    ) AS class_percentile,

    -- Interpretation
    CASE
        WHEN CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY exam_score) >= 0.9 THEN 'Top 10%'
        WHEN CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY exam_score) >= 0.75 THEN 'Top 25%'
        WHEN CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY exam_score) >= 0.5 THEN 'Above Average'
        ELSE 'Below Average'
    END AS performance_category
FROM student_scores
ORDER BY exam_score DESC;

```

_Result:_

```
student_id | student_name | exam_score | overall_percentile | percentile_score | class_percentile | performance_category
-----------|--------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------
101        | Alice        | 95         | 1.00              | 100.00           | 1.00             | Top 10%
102        | Bob          | 90         | 0.90              | 90.00            | 0.83             | Top 10%
103        | Charlie      | 85         | 0.80              | 80.00            | 0.67             | Top 25%
104        | David        | 75         | 0.60              | 60.00            | 0.50             | Above Average
105        | Eva          | 70         | 0.40              | 40.00            | 0.33             | Below Average

# _üîπ PERCENT_RANK() Function_

_PERCENT_RANK() calculates the relative rank of a row within a group as a percentage (0 to 1)._

### _**Syntax:**_

```sql
PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY column1, column2, ...]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...
)

```

### _**Formula:**_

_PERCENT_RANK = (RANK - 1) / (Total rows - 1)_

### _**Example 8: Percent Rank vs CUME_DIST Comparison**_

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS percent_rank,
    ROUND(PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) * 100, 2) AS percent_rank_pct,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS cumulative_dist,
    ROUND(CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) * 100, 2) AS cume_dist_pct,

    -- Difference explanation
    ROUND((CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) -
           PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)) * 100, 2) AS difference_pct
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;

```

# _üîπ Common Pitfalls and Solutions_

### _**Pitfall 1: LAST_VALUE without proper frame**_

```sql
-- ‚ùå Wrong: Only sees current row
LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date)

-- ‚úÖ Correct: Sees entire partition
LAST_VALUE(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)

```

### _**Pitfall 2: Misunderstanding CUME_DIST vs PERCENT_RANK**_

```sql
-- CUME_DIST: What percentage of values are <= current value
-- PERCENT_RANK: What percentage of values are < current value

-- For salary ranking (higher is better), use DESC order
CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)      -- Higher salary = higher percentile
PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)   -- Higher salary = higher percent rank

```

### _**Pitfall 3: NTILE with uneven groups**_

```sql
-- With 10 rows divided into 3 groups: sizes will be 4, 3, 3
-- First groups get the extra rows
SELECT value, NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY value) as tile
FROM (VALUES (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)) t(value);

```

_**‚úÖ Advantages ‚Üí Statistical power, performance benefits, code simplification, precise control, BI-ready.**_

_**‚ùå Disadvantages ‚Üí Memory impact, learning complexity, compatibility issues, debugging difficulty.**_

_üëâ Golden Rules:_

_**"Always use proper frame clause with LAST_VALUE"**_

_**"Use Window clause to avoid repetitive code"**_

_**"CUME_DIST for 'what percentage are <= me', PERCENT_RANK for 'what percentage are < me'"**_

_**"NTILE divides into roughly equal groups, first groups get extra rows"**_



_üëâ Golden Rules:_  
_**"Use RANK() when you need gaps for ties, DENSE_RANK() when you don't"**_ _**"Use LAG() to look backward, LEAD() to look forward in your data"**_ _**"Always consider indexing PARTITION BY and ORDER BY columns for performance"**_
