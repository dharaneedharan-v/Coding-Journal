## üí° What is a **Heap**?

A **heap** is a **special tree-based data structure** that satisfies the **heap property**.

There are two main types:

### ‚úÖ 1. **Min-Heap**:

- Every parent node is **less than or equal to** its children.
    
- So, the **smallest** element is always at the root.
    

### ‚úÖ 2. **Max-Heap**:

- Every parent node is **greater than or equal to** its children.
    
- So, the **largest** element is always at the root.


## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexities

| Operation     | Time Complexity |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Insert        | O(log n)        |
| Delete (Root) | O(log n)        |
| Peek (Root)   | O(1)            |
| Build Heap    | O(n)            |


## üì¶ Why Do We Use a Heap?

Because it's **efficient** when you want to:

- Continuously access the **highest** or **lowest** priority item (like in a **priority queue**).
    
- Sort elements efficiently (Heap Sort).

Solve problems like:

- K largest/smallest elements
    
- Median of data stream
    
- Merging k sorted arrays/lists
    
- Scheduling (like OS or event management)


## üß† Heap Properties

1. **Complete Binary Tree**:
    
    - All levels are full except possibly the last, which is filled **from left to right**.
        
2. **Heap Property**:
    
    - For **min-heap**: `parent <= children`
        
    - For **max-heap**: `parent >= children`
        
3. **Efficient Implementation**:
    
    - Usually implemented as an **array**, not using tree nodes.
        
    - You don‚Äôt need pointers to children.
        
    
    **Array Index Mapping** (0-based):
    
    - Parent: `i`
        
    - Left child: `2i + 1`
        
    - Right child: `2i + 2`
        
    - Parent of node at `i`: `(i - 1) // 2`


# Why do we need to use the heap?

##  ‚úÖ 1. **To Always Access the Highest or Lowest Priority Item Quickly**

### Why Heap?

- **Heap** keeps the **max or min element at the top**, always.
    
- You get:
    
    - **Peek (min/max)**: O(1)
        
    - **Insert**: O(log n)
        
    - **Remove min/max**: O(log n)
        

### Where It‚Äôs Useful:

- **Priority queues**
    
- **Task schedulers**
    
- __AI (A_ algorithm)_*
    
- **Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path**

## ‚úÖ 2. **To Handle Streaming or Dynamic Data**

### Why Heap?

- Merge sort, quick sort need **all data up front**.
    
- But what if:
    
    - Data is **arriving in chunks**?
        
    - You need to track the **top K elements** on the fly?
        

‚û°Ô∏è **Heap is ideal** for real-time updating and querying.

### Examples:

- **Kth largest element in a stream**
    
- **Median in a data stream** (using two heaps)
    

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **To Solve Top-K or Partial Sorting Problems Efficiently**

### Why Heap?

- You don‚Äôt need to sort the **whole array**.
    
- You can just maintain a **heap of size k**.
    

### Examples:

- **Top K frequent words**
    
- **Top K largest numbers**
    
- **Sort a nearly sorted (k-sorted) array**
    

Using a heap is **faster and more memory-efficient** than full sorting in these cases.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **To Merge Multiple Sorted Lists**

### Why Heap?

- Keep track of the **smallest element from each list** in a min-heap.
    
- Pop the smallest, push the next from that list.
    

### Example:

- **Merge k sorted arrays/lists** in O(n log k)
    

No other structure makes this as efficient.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **To Implement a Priority Queue**

This is the most important practical use of a heap.

### Why Heap?

- It‚Äôs **designed** for this.
    
- No need for full sorting.
    
- Better than:
    
    - Array (slow to find min/max)
        
    - Linked list (slow insertion/removal)
        

Languages like Python (`heapq`), Java (`PriorityQueue`), and C++ (`priority_queue`) all use **heaps internally**.

### üí° Priority Queue vs. Heap

- **Priority Queue** is a **concept** (or abstract data type).
    
- **Heap** is a **data structure** commonly used to **implement** a priority queue.

### üìò Analogy:

- A **car** (priority queue) takes you from A to B.
    
- The **engine** (heap) powers the car.



### INBUILD FUNCTION :  

Yes! ‚úÖ Python provides a built-in **heap module** called `heapq` ‚Äî it's part of the standard library and supports **Min Heap** functionality out of the box.

---

## ‚úÖ `heapq` Module in Python

### üîπ What it supports:

- Min Heap only (by default)
    
- Efficient `O(log n)` operations
    
- Works directly on **lists**
    

---

## üîß Basic Min Heap Example (Built-in)


```python
import heapq

# Initialize an empty heap
heap = []

# Push values
heapq.heappush(heap, 5)
heapq.heappush(heap, 1)
heapq.heappush(heap, 3)

# Peek at smallest (min)
print(heap[0])  # Output: 1

# Pop the smallest
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # Output: 1
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # Output: 3

```


---

## üîÑ Max Heap in Python (Using `heapq`)

Python's `heapq` only supports Min Heap ‚Äî but we can simulate a **Max Heap** by inserting negative values:



```python 
import heapq

nums = [1, 5, 3, 10]
max_heap = []

# Push negatives
for num in nums:
    heapq.heappush(max_heap, -num)

# Pop max (i.e., smallest negative)
print(-heapq.heappop(max_heap))  # Output: 10

```
